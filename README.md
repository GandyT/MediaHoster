watch videos with your friends!

supports direct mp4's and youtube urls

note: you must have a folder called youtubevideos in the backend directory. am too lazy to auto create it for you :D

todo: some videos take quite a long time to download so it would be nice if we could have a streaming route and stream it to the client instead. i don't 

feel like doing this ;-;
